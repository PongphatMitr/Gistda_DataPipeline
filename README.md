4Plant GeoJSON Processing
This repository contains a Python script that processes and merges GeoJSON files of plant data. The script reads multiple GeoJSON files, simplifies and buffers their geometries, cleans and repairs the geometries, and performs a union operation on the geometries. Finally, it applies conditions to create a new column indicating the plant status and saves the resulting data to CSV and GeoJSON files.
